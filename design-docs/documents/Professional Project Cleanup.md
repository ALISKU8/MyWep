Based on my analysis, the word "Trae" does not appear in any of your source code files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, etc.). The website code is already clean and professional.

The only reference to "Trae" is the hidden configuration folder **`.trae/`**, which contains the design plans and history of our session (e.g., "Fix Design Issues.md").

To address your request and make the project structure look professional for GitHub or delivery, I propose the following:

1. **Rename the Folder:** I will rename the `.trae` folder to **`design-docs`**. This preserves your project history and plans under a generic, professional name (`design-docs`) instead of a tool-specific name.
2. **Create a** **`.gitignore`** **file:** I will create a standard `.gitignore` file. This is a best practice for professional projects. It tells Git to ignore specific system files and local configurations so they don't clutter your repository.

   * I will add `design-docs/` to it (optional, but keeps the repo clean).

   * I will add common system files like `.DS_Store` and `Thumbs.db`.

**Plan:**

1. Rename directory `.trae` → `design-docs`.
2. Create `.gitignore` file.
